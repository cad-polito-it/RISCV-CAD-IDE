# RISCV-CAD-IDE
A development environment for RISCV ISA


# Makefile instruction
prova README (non so scriverli)

## Before
To use properly the makefile you must do this things before the first make

### yaml2make
In the yaml2make located in core-v-verif/bin you have to put your programs absolute path or relative path starting from the core-v-verif path, e.g. ../programs (relative) /home/usr/programs (absolute)

### Makefile variables
Either doing it by passing the variables in the command line or changing them in the Makefile, you must define the following variables:
<br>

* Test path, line 33/34, the default is path is set to be in the same dir of the Makefile;
* Core-v-verif, line 7, he default is path is set to be in the same dir of the Makefile;
* riscv toolchain, this isn't defined in the Makefile and should be defined as **CV_SW_TOOLCHAIN** with an export, e.g /home/usr/opt/riscv;
* toolchain prefix, this isn't defined in the Makefile and should be defined as **CV_SW_PREFIX** with an export, e.g riscv64-unknown-elf-;
* compiler, this isn't defined in the Makefile and should be defined as **CV_SW_CC** with an export, e.g gcc;
* configuration, the default definition and export is rv32imc_zicsr, but it can be changed;

### Your own programs
to make your own program create a directory in the programs directory and put in there your .c and .S files followed by a test.yaml file

## After
all the things created after the simulation

### simulation_result
simulation_result is the directory where the results and the verilator executable of the verilator simulation go when it finishes all the process.

### cobj_dir
cobj_result is the directory where it's stored the core testbench generated by the first run of the Makefile.

### memory_dump.bin
non c'ho veramente idea di che straminchia sia

## Run

### How to run it (verilator)
To run everything, once followed the "before" instructions, you can  simply type `$ make` and the base test (swhw1) will be run on verilator, but to run your custom program you have to type `$ make TEST="test_name"`

### How to run it (spike)
To run everything, once followed the "before" instructions, you can  simply type `$ make GOAL=spike` and the base test (swhw1) will be run on verilator, but to run your custom program you have to type `$ make GOAL=spike TEST="test_name"`

## Clean

### How to clean it (verilator)
If you want to clean all the file generated for verilator by the `$ make ...`, including all the tb, you havo to type `$ make clean`, with this all the .hex .elf ..., all the tb contained in cobj_dir and the simulation_results folder will be cleared.

### How to clean it (spike)
With spike you can decide if you want to clean all the file and folder generated by a spike simulation (`$ make GOAL=spike ...`) you have to use `$ make clean-spike` and all the files in spike_results will be trashed. If you want to clean only the files (object and executable) of a specific test run: `$ make clean-spike-test TEST='test_name'`.

## Modified
- /home/bellee21/tirocinio/tutti_i_git/core-v-verif/bin/objdump2itb : line 77, 83, 89 i added the "r" at the start of the variables
- /home/bellee21/tirocinio/tutti_i_git/core-v-verif/bin/yaml2make : added my path in line 57
- /home/bellee21/tirocinio/tutti_i_git/core-v-verif/cv32e40p/sim/core/Makefile : changed it to make it work on my pc

# RISCV-CAD-IDE

A development environment for RISCV ISA. Made for running simulation using two key tools: spike and Verilator (with core-v-verify).
The main target are Software Test Libraries (STLs), and with this enviroment you can either emulates the execution of RISC-V programs in software, making it ideal for bare-metal software development, or simulate and validate RISC-V cores at the RTL (Register Transfer Level) with core-v-verify that include SystemVerilog testbenches made to simulate an actual RISC-V processor such as CV32E40P.

## Spike

### Run

The spike simulation can be launched from the makefile typing `$ make GOAL=spike`, with this the default test (swhw1) will be run. To run a specific test the sintax is `$ make GOAL=spike TEST=test_name` where test_name is the name of the directory where the .c and .S are stored.
After the execution all the generated file will be placed in a directory named spike_results:
e.g.
spike_results/  
└── swhw1  
    ├── objects  
    │   └── swhw.o  
    └── swhw1_spike  
where swhw1_spike is the executable

### Clean

If you want to clean all the files and folders generated by a spike simulation (`$ make GOAL=spike ...`) you have to use `$ make clean-spike` and all the files in spike_results will be trashed. If you want to clean only the files (object and executable) of a specific test run: `$ make clean-spike-test TEST='test_name'`.

## Verilator

### Run

The Verilator simulation can be launched from the makefile typing `$ make GOAL=verilator` even though the GOAL can be omitted since verilator is the default, with this the default test (swhw1) will be run. To run a specific test the sintax is `$ make GOAL=verilator TEST=test_name` where test_name is the name of the directory where the .c and .S are stored.  
After the execution all the generated file will be placed in a directory named simulation_result:  
e.g  
simulation_results/  
└── swhw1  
    ├── 0  
    │   └── test_program  
    │       ├── bsp  
    │       │   ├── crt0.o  
    │       │   ├── handlers.o  
    │       │   ├── libcv-verif.a  
    │       │   ├── Makefile  
    │       │   ├── syscalls.o  
    │       │   └── vectors.o  
    │       └── swhw1.log  
    └── verilator_executable  
where verilator_executable is the executable.  
another directory created is cobj_result: the directory where it's stored the core testbench generated by the first run of the Makefile.  

### Clean

If you want to clean all the file generated for verilator by the `$ make ...`, including all the tb, you havo to type `$ make clean`, with this all the .hex .elf ..., all the tb contained in cobj_dir and the simulation_results folder will be cleared.

## Adding a new test program

All the tests are stored in the programs directory, to add a new test create a new directory and add all the .S files with the .c, then put a file test.yaml containing   name: "testname"  
uvm_test: uvmt_$(CV_CORE_LC)_firmware_test_c                #TODO: risolvere il problema di avere test.yaml  
description: >  
    "testname" sanity test  
since all of this is implemented the test can be executed.  
If you want to use the pulpino STLs copy the test in programs and add the yaml.

## Installing

### Main repo

Install the enviroment typing in the shell:  
`$ git clone https://github.com/cad-polito-it/RISCV-CAD-IDE.git`

### Dependencies

To work, the enviroment need: core-v-verify, RISC-V toolchain, spike, Verilator and the proxy kernel.  
All the repository should be already cloned into the main one but to complete all the installations follow the instruction given by the developers:

* [RISC-V toolchain](https://github.com/riscv-collab/riscv-gnu-toolchain.git) (riscv-gnu-toolchain) N.B. make sure to follow the 32-bit toolchain;
* [spike](https://github.com/riscv-software-src/riscv-isa-sim) (riscv-isa-sim);
* [proxy kernel](https://github.com/riscv-software-src/riscv-pk) (riscv-pk);
* [verilator](https://verilator.org/guide/latest/install.html);
* [core-v-verify](https://docs.openhwgroup.org/projects/core-v-verif/en/latest/quick_start.html);

### Variables

Some variables must be changed after the installation of the [dependencies](#dependencies):

#### yaml2make

In the yaml2make located in core-v-verif/bin put your programs absolute or relative path starting from the core-v-verif, e.g. ../programs (relative) /home/usr/programs (absolute)

#### Setup variables

To make it work there are some variables that must be defined. To do that you have to, in the shell, run `$ source setup.sh`.
Make sure to change the variable if needed:
<br>

* riscv toolchain, this isn't defined in the Makefile and should be defined as **CV_SW_TOOLCHAIN** with an export, e.g /home/usr/opt/riscv;
* toolchain prefix, this isn't defined in the Makefile and should be defined as **CV_SW_PREFIX** with an export, e.g riscv64-unknown-elf-;
* compiler, this isn't defined in the Makefile and should be defined as **CV_SW_CC** with an export, e.g gcc;
* configuration, the default definition and export is rv32imc_zicsr, but it can be changed;
